# Motivation

1. Some objects are simple and can be created in single constructor call
2. Other object require a lot of ceremony to create 
3. Havinb an object with 10 constructor arguments is not productive
4. Instead, opt for piecewise construction
5. Builder Provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step
